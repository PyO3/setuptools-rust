# Data files generated by Rust build scripts generally do not need to be listed in the manifest
# bceause they are not generated as part of the `sdist`; the Rust extension is also not bulit in an
# sdist, so neither are the generated files.  You should ensure that all source files needed to
# generate the build files _are_ included in the manifest, however.
